# Networking App MVP

A comprehensive professional networking application that helps users map their connections, discover job opportunities, and analyze their network relationships across multiple platforms.

## 🎯 Project Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Testing & Bug Fixes  
**Overall Progress**: 75% Complete  
**Next Milestone**: Resolve backend connectivity issues and complete admin dashboard testing

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Location**: `networking-app-backend/`
- **Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite
- **Key Features**: JWT Authentication, Admin Dashboard API, User Management, Analytics
- **Status**: ✅ Complete (with minor connectivity issues to resolve)

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Location**: `connect-me-nextjs/`
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
- **Key Features**: Admin Dashboard, User Management UI, Analytics Charts
- **Status**: ✅ Complete (pending backend integration testing)

## 📊 Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: MVP Backend Foundation (Week 1-2)
- FastAPI backend with JWT authentication
- User registration and login system
- Platform integration (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)
- Connection management with full CRUD operations
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Docker containerization

### ✅ Phase 2: Deployment & Frontend Integration (Week 2-3)
- Railway backend deployment
- React frontend components
- User registration/login UI
- Connection management interface
- Independent Next.js application

### ✅ Phase 3: Admin Dashboard & Analytics (Week 3-4)
- Admin authentication with role-based access
- Comprehensive analytics API endpoints
- Modern admin dashboard UI
- User management with search/filter
- Interactive data visualizations
- Business metrics tracking

## 🚧 Current Issues (Phase 4)

### High Priority
1. **Backend Port Conflict** - Port 8000 already in use, preventing server startup
2. **Admin Login Flow** - Frontend authentication stuck due to backend connectivity

### Resolution Steps
1. Identify and kill process using port 8000
2. Restart backend server successfully
3. Test complete admin login flow
4. Verify all API endpoints functionality

## 🔧 Quick Start

### Backend
```bash
cd networking-app-backend
python3 run_server.py
# Should start on http://localhost:8000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd connect-me-nextjs
npm run dev
# Should start on http://localhost:3002
```

### Admin Access
- URL: `http://localhost:3002/admin/login`
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## 📈 Business Metrics Available

When fully operational, the admin dashboard provides:
- User signup trends and growth analytics
- Platform usage distribution
- Connection creation metrics
- User engagement tracking
- Network relationship analysis

## 🎯 Next Phases (Planned)

### Phase 5: Production Optimization
- Database optimization for scale
- API rate limiting implementation
- Enhanced error handling
- Security hardening

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- Network analysis algorithms
- Job matching system
- Real-time notifications
- Mobile API support
